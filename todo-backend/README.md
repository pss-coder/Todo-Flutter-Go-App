go run webserver/main.go

- refactor everything using gin :) 
    - remove everything and start scratch
- abstract todo into a todo folder?? 
    -- seperate logic??
-- focus on building authentication layer first


How to Swagger for gin
https://github.com/swaggo/gin-swagger

Install dependecies in this order
- go get -u github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag



go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest


swag init <- call this everytime when there is update to update docs
// swag init --parseDependency <- to include gorm.Model in struct else won't work

go get -u github.com/swaggo/gin-swagger
go get -u github.com/swaggo/files


iN main.go - add this imports
swaggerFiles "github.com/swaggo/files"
ginSwagger "github.com/swaggo/gin-swagger"
docs "todo-backend/docs" // docs is generated by Swag CLI, you have to import it.

start server, and visit
localhost:8080/swagger/index.html
